### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories. Currently the data file has anes_timeseries_2012_userguidecodebook and anes_timeseries_2012.sav.
